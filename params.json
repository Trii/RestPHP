A simple way to refer to resources\r\n\r\n2. An even simpler way to announce our intent using HTTP\r\n   verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)\r\n\r\n3. A full list of response codes to inform the client of the\r\n   status of their request\r\n\r\n4. Automatic content negotiation via the Accept header as well as Character Set,\r\n   Encoding and Language\r\n\r\nWhat ISN'T RestPHP?\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nRestPHP is not a full stack framework. There are a ton of those our there\r\nalready. RestPHP only provides the framework to take advantage of what HTTP\r\nwas intended to give us.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPHP 5.3+\r\n\r\nZend Framework http://framework.zend.com\r\nWe use Zend_Config and Zend_Json* packages right now.
