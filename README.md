RestPHP Framework (http://restphp.com)

What is RestPHP?
----------------

RestPHP is a php framework for creating RESTful applications
and APIs that rely on what HTTP already provides us:

1. A simple way to refer to resources

2. An even simpler way to announce our intent using HTTP
   verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)

3. A full list of response codes to inform the client of the
   status of their request

4. Automatic content negotiation via the Accept header as well as Character Set,
   Encoding and Language

What ISN'T RestPHP?
----------------

RestPHP is not a full stack framework. There are a ton of those our there
already. RestPHP only provides the framework to take advantage of what HTTP
was intended to give us.
