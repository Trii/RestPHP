RestPHP Framework (http://www.restphp.com)

What is RestPHP?
----------------

RestPHP is a php framework for creating RESTful applications
and APIs that rely on what HTTP already provides us:

1. A simple way to refer to resources

2. An even simpler way to announce our intent using HTTP
   verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)

3. A full list of response codes to inform the client of the
   status of their request
